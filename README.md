The transportation industry is experiencing rapid transformation with the integration of
advanced technologies, particularly in autonomous driving systems. To enhance road safety,
reduce human error and improve driving efficiency, development in computer vision, especially
lane detection algorithms have gained a lot of attention. As a driver myself, I can observe a future
push in demand for automatic vehicles. With the implementation of this system, traffic accidents
can be significantly reduced, and drivers’ experience can be more comfortable. For this reason,
through this First Capstone Project, I have decided to research the topic "Python-Based Lane
Detection Algorithm using Computer Vision" as it plays an important role in ensuring vehicle
safety, maintaining proper lane positioning and enabling autonomous navigation capabilities.

Through this project, I was given the opportunity to explore and address real-world
challenges in computer vision applications used in the automotive industry to further understand
and analyze the advantages and limitations of different detection algorithms. Additionally, I was
able to apply and solidify knowledge learned from computer science courses, develop skills in
using computer vision libraries like OpenCV, NumPy and image processing techniques, as well as
enhance programming abilities in Python and soft skills such as problem-solving, analytical
thinking, and technical documentation.

Finally, this project provides me with valuable experience in developing computer vision
systems, evaluating and fine-tuning algorithm performance under various conditions, and
preparing comprehensive technical reports for engineering applications.
